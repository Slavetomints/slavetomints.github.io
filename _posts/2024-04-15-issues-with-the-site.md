## Favicon doesnt show the mint

Yes, this is an issue I have been having with Chirpy. Sometimes when I build the site it doesn't see the favicon images I've loaded up and instead generates the deafult one. Yes its annoying, yes it'll probably be fixed the next time GitHub Actions builds the site.


## Icons dont load and instead show the hex codes.
That is an issue with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), and it is browser based.
- [This article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS/Errors/CORSDidNotSucceed) explains what it is
- [This article](https://medium.com/@stephen.biston/resolve-cors-errors-once-and-for-all-three-methods-d821c258d025) gives some suggestions on fixing it

## I can't comment
In order to comment on the site you need to have a GitHub account, and also you need to authorize with Giscus in order to comment since it used GitHub discussions as the "backend".

## Stuff isnt loading right
If you have a JavaScript blocker, allow JavaScript for the site. If thats not the case, try clearing your browser cache and reloading from a different tab. If all else fails, shoot me an [email](mailto:slavetomints@gmail.com), or open an issue on the [repository](https://github.com/slavetomints/slavetomints.github.io).
