Again, another warmup question, they'll have to check out their twitter youtube and reddit to get the pieces of the flag that you need. After that you'll need to decode them to spell out your message.

INTIGRITI{0110100000110000011100000011001101011111011110010011000001110101+5f336e6a30795f+ZDRfYzdm}

 The first part is obviously `binary`, then `hexadecimal`, then `base64`. A quick run through of `CyberChef` should sort things out.

FLAG: `INTIGRITI{h0p3_y0u_3nj0y_d4_c7f}`
