So here we are given two tiny little GIFs, so lets take a look at them!

Immediately when given a GIF my first though is to extract each frame from it, so I can see it better. It doesn't matter what you use, just don't be clinking on random links. The extracted images of interest are as follows:

## Elementary My Dear Watson!

I've seen this before, this looks like the `Dancing Man cipher`, which first debuted in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Adventure of the Dancing Men". It is a simple substitution cipher that has a different position of the characters arms and legs for different letters and numbers, the key is as follows:

Going back through each frame, we'll end up with `CIPHERED` and `DANCE`, which makes our flag!

FLAG: `VishwaCTF{CIPHERED_DANCE}`
